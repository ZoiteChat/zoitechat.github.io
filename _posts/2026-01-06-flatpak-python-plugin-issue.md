title: Flatpak known issue: Python plugin
summary: Python plugin currently breaks the Flatpak build
---

If you’re using the Flatpak build: enabling the **Python plugin** can cause the client to stop functioning (appears to “freeze” when connecting).

### Workaround

- Disable the Python plugin for now.

### Status

A fix is in progress. When the Flatpak is updated, this post will be updated as well.
