title: "ZoiteChat 2.17.0 (first public codebase)"
---

ZoiteChat begins life as a fork of the HexChat codebase, starting from **HexChat {{ site.hexchat_base_version }}**.

This first public baseline is tagged internally as **ZoiteChat {{ site.zoitechat_initial_version }}**.

### What to expect

- Same familiar HexChat workflow (networks, channels, per-network identities).
- A quieter, cleaner default experience: fewer noisy extras, fewer assumptions.
- Packaging is still settling. Flatpak is the current focus.

### Known issues

- **Flatpak: the Python plugin can freeze the client.** Until it’s fixed, run with `--no-plugins` or disable the Python plugin.
