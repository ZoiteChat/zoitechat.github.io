# ZoiteChat website

This is a **GitHub Pages / Jekyll** site (same framework style as the original HexChat website).

## Edit

Most pages are Markdown with a small bit of HTML for layout:

- `index.md`
- `downloads.md`
- `news.md`
- `_posts/*.md`

## Run locally (optional)

If you already have Ruby + Bundler installed:

```bash
gem install bundler jekyll
jekyll serve --livereload
```

Then open the local URL printed by Jekyll.

## Docs link

Docs are expected at:

- `/docs/en/latest/`

(That path is hard-coded by design.)
